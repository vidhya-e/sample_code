A perfect cube of a number is a number that is equal to the number, multiplied by itself, three times.
Input: 125
Output: 125 is an Ideal Cube

class Ideal_Cube {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n=125;
        int i=1,mul=0,k=0;
        
        while(k==0)
        {
            mul=i*i*i;
            if(mul==n)
               k=1;
            i++;
            if(mul>n)       // if it exceeds then it can't be a cube number
               break;
        }
        if(k==1)
        System.out.println(n+" is an Ideal Cube");
        else
        System.out.println(n+" is not an Ideal Cube");
    }
}
