A Duck number is a positive number which has zeroes present in it, For example 3210, 8050896, 70709 are all Duck numbers. Please note that a numbers with only 
leading 0s is not considered as Duck Number. For example, numbers like 035 or 0012 are not considered as Duck Numbers. A number like 01203 is considered as Duck
because there is a non-leading 0 present in it.

Input : 707069     (Explanation: 707069 does not contains zeros at the beginning)
Output : It is a duck number. 

Input : 02364        (Explanation: in 02364 there is a zero at the beginning of the number)
Output : It is not a duck number.

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int i,c=0;
        
       for(i=1;i<num.length();i++)

        else if(num.charAt(0)=='0')                                       // it checks for leading 0
