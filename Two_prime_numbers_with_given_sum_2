QUESTION: Given an number(n), print two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number. There may be several combinations possible. Print only all possible such pair. 
INPUT_1: 50
OUTPUT_1 : 
3 + 47  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. 
7 + 43  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. 
13 + 37  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. 
19 + 31  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers.

PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n,i,j,count=0;
    printf("Enter the number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    for(i=2;i<=n/2;i++)
    {
        int num1=i;
        int num2=n-i;
        int prime_count_num1=prime(num1);
        int prime_count_num2=prime(num2);
        if(prime_count_num1==0 && prime_count_num2==0){
        printf("%d + %d  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. \n",num1,num2);
        count++;
        }
    }
    if(count==0)
    printf("There is no summation that as both numbers as prime");
    return 0;
}

int prime(int number)                          // Instead of using the for loop, we have used the user-function to reduce the recurrence of code 
{
    int i,prime_count_number=0;
    for(i=2;i<number;i++)
        {
            if(number%i==0)
            prime_count_number++;
        }
    return prime_count_number;
}
