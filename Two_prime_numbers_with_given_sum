QUESTION: Given an number(n), print two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number. There may be several combinations possible. Print only all possible such pair. 
INPUT_1: 14
OUTPUT_1: 
3 + 11  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. 
7 + 7  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. 

INPUT_2: 3
OUTPUT_2: There is no summation that as both numbers as prime.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n,i,j,count=0;
    printf("Enter the number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    for(i=2;i<=n/2;i++)
    {
        int num1=i;
        int num2=n-i;
        int prime_count_num1=0;
        int prime_count_num2=0;
        for(j=2;j<num1;j++)             // staring with number=2 and ending with less than num1, so that factors is equal to 0 for prime numbers
        {
            if(num1%j==0)
            prime_count_num1++;
        }
        for(j=2;j<num2;j++)
        {
            if(num2%j==0)
            prime_count_num2++;
        }
        
        if(prime_count_num1==0 && prime_count_num2==0){
        printf("%d + %d  is the summation that has both summation numbers as prime numbers. \n",num1,num2);
        count++;
        }
    }
    if(count==0)
    printf("There is no summation that as both numbers as prime");
    return 0;
