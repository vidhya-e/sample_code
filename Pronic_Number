Pronic number can be defined as a number when it is a product of two consecutive integers.
Input: 12    (4 * 3 = 12, where 3 and 4 are two consecutive numbers.)
Output: 12 is a Pronic Number

class Pronic_Number {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n=18;
        int i,k=0;;
        
        for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            if(n%i==0 && n%(i+1)==0 && i*(i+1)==n)       n should divided by i and i+1    and at the same time i*i+1 must be equal to n
            k=1;
        }
        if(k==1)
        System.out.println(n+" is a Pronic Number");
        else
        System.out.println(n+" is NOT a Pronic Number");
    }
}
