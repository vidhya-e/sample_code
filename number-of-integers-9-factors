Questions:Given a number n(1<=n<=109), the task is to find the total number of integers less than equal to n which have exactly 9 divisors.
Examples:  
Input_1: n = 100 
Output_1: 2 
The two numbers which have exactly 9 divisors are 36 and 100. 
Input_2: n = 1000 
Output_2: 8 
The numbers are 36 100 196 225 256 441 484 676 

PROGRAM: 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    int i,j;
    printf("Enter the range upto which we are going to find: ");
    scanf("%d",&n); 
    
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
    {
        int count=0;
        for(j=1;j<=i;j++)
        {
                                //printf("j==%d\n",j);
            if(i%j==0)
                count++;
        }
                              //printf("i= %d   and count=%d \n ",i,count);
        if(count==9)
        printf("%d has exactly 9 factors\n",i);
    }
    return 0;
}
