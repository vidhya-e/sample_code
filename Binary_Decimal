Output:
Binary To Decimal: 
110 = 6  ( here we have stored n in int so if n=0111 it should give the value of 7 but it considers it as octal as 0 is present at the start so to avoid this we can 
                 get n from user as string).

class Binary_Decimal{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Binary To Decimal: \n");
        int n=110,i,sum=0,j=0,num=0,len;
        String s=Integer.toString(n);             // It is best to get the value of n as string itself, instead of getting it as int and converting to string.
        len=s.length();                                                               //So it doesnt mistake it as octal.
        
        for(i=len-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            num=s.charAt(j)-'0';                // character to integer
            sum=sum+(int)(num*Math.pow(2,i));       //  1*2^2 +1* 2^1 + 0* 2^0
            j++;
            
        }
        System.out.printf(" %s = %d ",s,sum);
