A number n is said to be Deficient Number if sum of all the divisors of the number denoted by divisorsSum(n) is less than twice the value of the number n.
Input1: 21    (Divisors are 1, 3, 7 and 21. Sum of divisors is 32.
This sum is less than 2*21 or 42.)
Output1: 21 is a Deficient Number
Input2: 12
Output2: 12 is NOT a Deficient Number
